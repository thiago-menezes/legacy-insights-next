# Legacy Insight - Project Description

**Legacy Insight** is a premium centralized analytics and business intelligence platform designed to aggregate marketing, sales, and performance data from multiple sources into a single, intuitive interface. The project aims to eliminate "data fragmentation" for digital entrepreneurs by providing a unified hub for cross-platform monitoring and decision-making.

## Objective

The primary mission of Legacy Insight is to provide real-time visibility into advertising performance and sales conversions. By integrating directly with major ad networks and digital product marketplaces, it allows users to track their entire customer journey—from the first click on an ad to the final purchase—in one place.

## Core Integrations

Currently, the platform supports two main types of integrations:

- **Advertising Networks:** Full integration with **Google Ads** and **Meta Ads** (including Facebook and Instagram metrics).
- **Sales Platforms (via Webhooks):** Real-time data synchronization with leading digital product platforms such as **Hotmart**, **Kiwify**, and **Kirvano**.

## Key Features & Functionality

### 1. Unified Performance Dashboard

The heart of the platform is a high-level analytics view that monitors the most critical business KPIs:

- **Financial Metrics:** Track "Value Invested" (Spend) and ROI across different channels.
- **Lead Performance:** Monitor lead volume and growth trends with percentage comparisons against previous periods.
- **Efficiency Ratios:** Real-time tracking of **CPA (Cost per Acquisition)** and **Sales Conversion Rates**.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Visual indicators showing performance trends compared to past timeframes.

### 2. Granular Campaign Management

Detailed views for both Google and Meta campaigns allow users to drill down into specific data points:

- **Campaign Status:** Instant visibility into which campaigns are "Active", "Deactivated", or "Finished".
- **Asset-Level Data:** Track performance by specific pages or campaign sets, including budget allocation, link clicks, **CPC (Cost Per Click)**, and **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**.
- **Customizable UI:** Users can "Edit Charts" and "Edit Tables" to customize the layout according to their specific analytical needs.

### 3. Centralized Integration Hub

A streamlined management module for all external connections:

- **Multi-Account Support:** Connect and manage multiple profiles/accounts per platform under a single workspace.
- **Connectivity Monitoring:** Visual alerts for connection health, including "Connected" status and "Expired Token" warnings.
- **Sync Control:** Features to trigger manual data synchronization and update authentication tokens.

### 4. Advanced UX/UI Design

- **Dark/Light Mode:** Full support for theme switching to accommodate user preference.
- **Workspace Management:** Capability to organize data into different "Workspaces" (e.g., "Grupo Ser"), ideal for agencies or multi-brand entrepreneurs.
